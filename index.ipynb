You know that somewhere in that folder is the exact image you want, but you can't remember the filename or what day you saved it. There's nothing you can do. You have to scroll through the folder, skimming hundreds of thumbnails, hoping you don't accidentally miss it, hoping you'll recognize it when you do see it. \n",

    "You can do this over thousands of images (it's not optimized for performance yet, but search times scale well under O(n)). \n",

    "Under the hood, `memery` makes use of **CLIP**, the [Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining transformer](https://github.com/openai/CLIP), released by OpenAI in 2021. CLIP trains a vision transformer and a language transformer to find the same latent space for images and their captions. This makes it perfect for the purpose of natural language image search. CLIP is a giant achievement, and `memery` stands on its shoulders."
